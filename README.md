# Language Detection and Translation 
## Introduction
Translation is necessary for the spreading of new information, knowledge, and ideas across the world. It is absolutely necessary to achieve effective communication between different cultures. In the process of spreading new information, translation is something that can change history. It is the only medium by which certain people can know different works that will expand their knowledge of the world. 

For this reason, it was needed to build a language translator and also a detector with which the user can detect and translate their desired language. This code can be implemented in areas like chat apps where two people can communicate with each other using their native languages. We can also use them for multiplayer games where players from different countries will be able to chat with each other using their native language for better strategic decisions on how to beat the other players in the game. This project has a wide array of applications it can be embedded into.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project, Language_Detection, comprises 15+ languages and
comprises 10,000+ entries. This dataset was obtained from kaggle.
